1. Cytoplasmic rRNA depletion only RNA preps are preferred
2. PolyA RNA preps are ok, but be aware of potential over amplofying degraded products
3. Cyotplasmic and mitochondrial rRNA preps are the least preferred because 12S and 16S reads are discarded and potentially pre-processed reads too

4. For mass spec PRIDE data, consider using SearchGUI/PeptideShaker for analysis, which is what Bruno from tbhe Brawnin paper used. This is not likely to yield positive results, but it's worth a shot and I consider it valuable because it will teach our about mass sepc limitations/advantages.
